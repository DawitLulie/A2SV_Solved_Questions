## About This Repository

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">
  This repository contains <b>my daily solved problems</b> from multiple platforms including <b>LeetCode</b>, <b>Codeforces</b>, <b>GeeksforGeeks</b>, and <b>HackerRank</b>. 
  I also add solutions from <b>weekly contests</b> to track my progress and strengthen my problem-solving skills.
</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">
  My goal is to maintain consistent daily practice and compile high-quality Python solutions for easy reference.
</p>

## Repository Structure

I organized all solved problems into subfolders by platform:

``` bash
A2SV_Solved_Questions/
├── leetcode/ # Daily LeetCode solutions
├── codeforces/ # Competitive programming solutions
├── geeksforgeeks/ # GFG practice problems
├── hackerrank/ # HackerRank challenges
```


Each file is named using the **problem number and title**, for example: `76-Minimum-Window-Substring.py`.
